* TODO Modularize install scripts.
  Should be able to list sub-modules, and run an arbitrary module. This will also get rid of the artificial separation of pre_ and post_ install scripts.

* TODO Better user input.
  Replace the tens of y/n prompts with something smarter. At the very least the prompts should be compatible with the yes command. ie yes | install.sh should not require any further prompts except for sudo credentials.
